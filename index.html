						<h2>About</h2>
						<p>The history of the city of Tokyo stretches back some 400 years. Originally named Edo, the city started to flourish after Tokugawa Ieyasu established the Tokugawa Shogunate here in 1603. As the center of politics and culture in Japan, Edo grew into a huge city with a population of over a million by the mid-eighteenth century. Throughout this time, the Emperor resided in Kyoto, which was the formal capital of the nation. The Edo Period lasted for nearly 260 years until the Meiji Restoration in 1868, when the Tokugawa Shogunate ended and imperial rule was restored. The Emperor moved to Edo, which was renamed Tokyo. Thus, Tokyo became the capital of Japan. During the Meiji era (1868-1912), Japan began its avid assimilation of Western civilization. Buildings made of stone and bricks were built on the sites of the mansions of feudal lords, and the major roads were paved with round stones...</p>

						<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
						<h5>Don't tip</h5>
						<p>Attentive service is the norm in Japan, part of a cultural dedication to hospitality called Omotenashi</p>
						<h5>Smoke inside, drink outside</h5>
						<p>The more enclosed a space is, the more likely you'll be allowed to smoke there. On the other hand, smoking is prohibited on many sidewalks. Even cracking open a beer or can of fruity, boozy chu-hai on the walk or train home is a cherished tradition</p>
						<h5>Walk right -- on the left</h5>
						<p>With more than 35 million people, greater Tokyo is one of the most densely populated urban centers in the world. Yet crowds are orderly.
Everyone waits until the light changes to cross the street. Pedestrians on wide sidewalks follow the unspoken rule of staying to the left almost as strictly as cars (also on the left) do.</p>
